# BNF coverage gate

This repo now keeps a machine-readable coverage map for the SysML/KerML textual BNF:

- coverage map: `docs/bnf_coverage.map`
- gate: `tests/bnf_compliance.rs`
- normative BNF source: `SYSML_V2_RELEASE_DIR/bnf/*.kebnf`, defaulting to `./sysml-v2-release` in the repo root

The coverage status labels are:

- `implemented`: grammar production has dedicated parser coverage and should not rely on opaque body skipping.
- `partial`: parser accepts known/common forms, but grammar depth is not yet complete.
- `opaque`: parser recognizes the construct but skips brace-body contents.
- `fallback`: production is represented by modeled fallback nodes rather than a construct-specific AST.
- `untested`: production is known in the BNF but still needs coverage classification work.
- `not_supported`: intentionally out of scope for this textual parser.

Run the gate with:

```powershell
cargo test --test bnf_compliance -- --nocapture
```

The test fails when a BNF production is not covered by the map, when two equally-specific rules assign conflicting statuses, or when the BNF production counts drift from the current SysML v2 release baseline.
